Hi.  I'm Brian.  

I've wrangled software for years now - web, enterprise stack, devops, you name it.  I solve complicated new problems, and I untangle byzantine legacy codebases.  I like to work with folks inside and outside of tech - I love to  make complex problems comprehensible and, most importantly, get them solved.  

Please let me know how I can help your business thrive!: <a href="mailto:info@bitpan.com">info@bitpan.com</a>

(Also, while work is important, I also love to cook (instant pot or bbq are current foci; always working on unlocking the best roaasted veggies), am learning archery (recurve target shooting, mostly badly), care for a rabbit (a senior sweetheart), and am learning to solder (slowly... I'll build the perfect keyboard someday...)
